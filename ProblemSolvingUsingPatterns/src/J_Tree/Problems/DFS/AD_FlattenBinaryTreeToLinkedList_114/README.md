# 114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

## Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, **flatten the tree into a "linked list"**:

- The "linked list" should use the same `TreeNode` class where the **right child pointer** points to the next node in the list.
- The **left child pointer** is always `null`.
- The order of the linked list should follow the **pre-order traversal** of the binary tree.
