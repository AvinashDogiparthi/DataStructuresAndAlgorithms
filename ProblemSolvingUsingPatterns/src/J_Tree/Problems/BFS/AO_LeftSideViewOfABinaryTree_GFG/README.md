## Problem Description

Given the **root** of a binary tree, return the **left view** of the binary tree.

The **left view** of a binary tree is the set of nodes visible when the tree is viewed from the **left side**.

If the tree is empty, return an empty list.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**
root = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, N, N]


**Output:**
[1, 2, 4]


**Explanation:**  
From the left side of the tree, only the nodes `1`, `2`, and `4` are visible.

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**
root = [1, 2, 3, N, N, 4, N, N, 5, N, N]

**Output:**
[1, 2, 4, 5]


**Explanation:**  
From the left side of the tree, only the nodes `1`, `2`, `4`, and `5` are visible.

## Constraints

- `0 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10⁵`
- `0 ≤ node -> data ≤ 10⁵`
