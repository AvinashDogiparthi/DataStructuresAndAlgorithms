# 63. Unique Paths II

## Problem Link
[LeetCode - Unique Paths II](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/)

## Problem Statement
You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid`. A robot is initially located at the **top-left corner** (`grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (`grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either **down** or **right** at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as `1` or `0` respectively in the grid. A path that the robot takes **cannot include any square that is an obstacle**.

Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be **less than or equal to 2 * 10^9**.
