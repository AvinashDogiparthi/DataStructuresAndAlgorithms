## Problem Description

Given a sorted array of integers `nums` in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to **search for the target in nums**. If the target exists, return its **index**. Otherwise, return **-1**.

You **must** write an algorithm with **O(log n)** runtime complexity.

## Example 1

**Input:**
```text
nums = [-1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 12], target = 9 
```

**Output:**
4

**Explanation:**
The number 9 exists in nums and its index is 4.


## Constraints
* 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
* -10^4 < nums[i], target < 10^4
* All integers in nums are unique 
* nums is sorted in ascending order
