## Problem Statement

The **Fibonacci numbers**, commonly denoted `F(n)`, form a sequence such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from `0` and `1`.

Mathematically:
- `F(0) = 0`
- `F(1) = 1`
- `F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)` for `n > 1`

Given an integer `n`, return `F(n)`.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**
n = 2

**Output:**
1

**Explanation:**
F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1
