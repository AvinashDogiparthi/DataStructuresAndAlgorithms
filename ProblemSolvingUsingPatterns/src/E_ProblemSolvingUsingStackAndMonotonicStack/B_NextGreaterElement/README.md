🔗 [LeetCode Problem - Next Greater Element I](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/)

## Problem Statement
The **next greater element** of some element `x` in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of `x` in the same array.

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, where `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`.

For each `0 <= i < nums1.length`, find the index `j` such that `nums1[i] == nums2[j]` and determine the next greater element of `nums2[j]` in `nums2`. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is `-1`.

Return an array `ans` of length `nums1.length` such that `ans[i]` is the next greater element as described above.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**
nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]

**Output:**
[-1,3,-1]

**Explanation:**
- 4 → no next greater element → -1
- 1 → next greater element is 3
- 2 → no next greater element → -1

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**
nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]


**Output:**
[3,-1]


**Explanation:**
- 2 → next greater element is 3
- 4 → no next greater element → -1

## Constraints
- `1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^4`
- All integers in `nums1` and `nums2` are unique.
- All the integers of `nums1` also appear in `nums2`.
