## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive, return the *duplicate* number.

There is **only one repeated number**, but it could be repeated **more than once**.

You must solve the problem **without modifying the array `nums`** and using **only constant extra space**.

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10⁵`
- `nums.length == n + 1`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All the integers in `nums` appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.
