## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return **true** if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, and **false** otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters **without disturbing the relative order** of the remaining characters.

- Example: `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`
- Example: `"aec"` is **not** a subsequence of `"abcde"`
