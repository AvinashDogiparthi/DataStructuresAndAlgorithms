# [1557. Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-vertices-to-reach-all-nodes/)

## Problem Statement

Given a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)**, with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n - 1`,  
and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [from_i, to_i]` represents a directed edge from node `from_i` to node `to_i`.

Find the **smallest set of vertices** from which all nodes in the graph are reachable.  
It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.

You can return the vertices in any order.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

**Input:**
n = 6
edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,5],[3,4],[4,2]]

**Output:**
[0,3]


**Explanation:**  
It's not possible to reach all nodes from a single vertex.  
From `0` we can reach `[0,1,2,5]`.  
From `3` we can reach `[3,4,2,5]`.  
So we output `[0,3]`.

---

**Example 2:**

**Input:**
n = 5
edges = [[0,1],[2,1],[3,1],[1,4],[2,4]]


**Output:**
[0,2,3]


**Explanation:**  
Vertices `0`, `2`, and `3` are not reachable from any other node,  
so we must include them.  
Also, any of these vertices can reach nodes `1` and `4`.

### Constraints
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= edges.length <= min(10^5, n * (n - 1) / 2)`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= from_i, to_i < n`
- All pairs `(from_i, to_i)` are distinct.
